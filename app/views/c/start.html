      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li>chemistry</li>
        <li>computing, including digital and ICT</li>
        <li>early years</li>
        <li>engineering and manufacturing, including transport engineering and electronics</li>
        <li>maths</li>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href='#'>the FE provider you teach in [link list of eligible FE providers/matching value payment - TBC summer ‘24]</a></li>

        How to apply
      </h2>

      <p>The application checks your eligibility before you apply. Once you start the application you cannot save your progress, so you may find it useful to have the following information to hand:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your contract or written statement of employment</li>
        <li>your teaching timetable</li>
        <li>the name of your college or sixth-form group, if your FE provider is part of one</li>
      </ul>


      <p>If you’re employed on a variable-hours contract, you must have an ongoing commitment from your employer for future hours. We'll check this with your employer after you submit your application, so you should discuss your future hours with them before you apply.</p>

      <p>Answering questions about eligibility takes 10 minutes and applying for the payment takes another 5 minutes.</p>
