        Payments and deductions
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you meet the eligibility criteria, you could be eligible for between £2,000 and £6,000. The amount you are eligible for depends on:      
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href='#'>the FE provider you teach in </a></li>
        <li>the number of hours you teach</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The incentive payment is taxable income, so the amount you receive may be lower following tax deductions. If you are currently paying off a student loan, a deduction from your payment will also go towards repaying it.
